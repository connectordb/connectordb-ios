# The ConnectorDB iOS app

In order to be able to share as much code as possible with android, the app will be built in react native. Unfortunately, the most critical part of the app, data logging, has to custom-built for iOS.

Since we currently do not have iphones (or macs) to perform testing on, this repository is mainly to spur possible contributors to help us out.

## How to help

Open an issue with the component that you think you'd be able to add to the app. We are mainly looking for people who can get the data logging code working, since we can build/test much of the basic UI using android (react-native is pretty cool).
